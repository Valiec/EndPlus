Char:

	General info:

		New block: Ash (NOT solid)

		Ground primarily composed of a new block, Char Obsidian (I don't think the texture of regular obsidian looks good as a surface material)

		compasses don't work here

		Biomes:

			Ash Plains: ash-covered plains, frequent lava lakes and small caverns, frequent creep patches
				contains "River" sub-biomes which contain very high quantities of mineral ores

			Molten Inferno: lava sea, occaisonal ash-covered obsidian islands

			Infested Lands: plains covered in creep with frequent lava lakes and small caverns

		Structures:

			Zerg Spawning Pool

			Zerg Spire

			Ruined Terran Settlement (rare)


	For dimension creation:
			
			Char will be a dimension (dim id 2) with the biomes listed above. The Zerg structures that spawn in the Infected biome will spawn here in all biomes (but only on creep!). As I listed above, compasses will not work here (as in the Nether).


It would be a bit easier to code this if I had access to the source for the mod, but if I don't I could code this without it, but the Zerg structures would be missing (since I' not going to recode them from scratch).
