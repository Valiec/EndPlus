§3I see the player you mean.

§2PLAYERNAME?

§3Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.

§2That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.

§3I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.

§2It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.

§3That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.

§2Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.

§3They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.

§2What did this player dream?

§3This player dreamed of the end of the world, the destruction of an entire dimension.

§2Another Enderdragon?

§3No. And not the Wither either. This player is worse.

§2Who is he?

§3He was made by a glitch in the code. Glitches and errors appear wherever he goes.

§2His name is §f§k§a§bnull§r

§3You are §f§k§a§bnull§r.

§3You are the player.

§2Wake up.
